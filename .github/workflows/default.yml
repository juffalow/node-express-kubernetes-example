# There are only two main events that can happen:
# * push / merge to the master
# * release
#
# When anyone push anything to the master, we want to run
# some default checks like lint, tests, or if build passes.
# If these checks are successful, we want to build the whole
# project as container and push it to container registry.
# In case of dev environment available, re-deploy latest version.
#
# Second case is, when some new feature or fix is ready
# and it should go public. In this case, we can create a release
# in GitHub and publish it. This will trigger release event
# with the tag set in GITHUB_REF env variable. We can again
# run all checks and build container but this time it is not
# tagged as "latest", but the tag from the release is used.
